1. Refactor methods (mainly located in Misc/Extensions.cs) for checking (sub)typing information and resolving
   type/field/method definitions. Ideally, the methods should directly call CCI functions. Currently, it is a
   mix of everything.

2. Refactor (abstract domain) set datastructures to use HashSets instead of Lists, for performance reasons.

3. There are few TODOs in the code. Addressing them would make the code look cleaner.
